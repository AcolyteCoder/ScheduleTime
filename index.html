        Homework helper was made with inspiration from school progress by Grant Garbe and with help from Grant Garbe.
        Here we begin, in a place that feels oddly familiar but impossible to describe. The air smells like forgotten dreams, and the ground beneath us seems to hum, though no one dares to ask why. "<a href="hint1.html" class="clickable-word">Its here</a>", said the guide with a flourish, "this is where it all starts."
        
        No one in the group knew what he meant. Was it here that history was made? Was it here that mysteries were born? Or was it just a random patch of earth he pointed to because he liked the way the sun hit it at that exact moment? Regardless, everyone nodded as if they understood.
        
        As we continued down the path, someone whispered, "Are we still here, or are we there now?" The question lingered awkwardly in the air, unanswered. It seemed here had an uncanny ability to stretch, to follow us, to cling to our shoes like sticky mud.
        
        The guide stopped suddenly, pointing to a crooked sign with illegible writing. Here lies the truth," he said solemnly. The group leaned in, squinting at the faded letters, but no one could make sense of it. One brave soul asked, "What truth is here?"
        
        The guide smiled, shrugged, and said, "That depends on what you're looking for. Truth is always here, you just have to know how to see it."
        
        The journey continued, but the idea of here grew heavier. It wasn’t just a place—it was a feeling, a challenge, maybe even a trick. By the time we reached the end of the path, no one knew if we were still here or somewhere else entirely. But maybe, just maybe,here was exactly where we were meant to be all along.
